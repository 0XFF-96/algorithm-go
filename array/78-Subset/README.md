### 加油！
I have a message for anyone who sees this examples as difficult:

Don't let your brain fool you. When encountering something we don't know, our brain is extremely, EXTREMELY good at convincing us that given task is either: too complicated for us, too boring for us or both. See through it. Look at the whole picture. For example. You have some skills that are easy for you now. Let's say typing on keyboard. Do you remember how hard it was in the beginning of developing that skill? And how your brain made same assumptions about what you are doing, that this is maybe stupid, or boring, and who the fuck placed those stupid keys in this non alphabetical order?. Try to remember exactly that feeling, then how you overcome it, and how it is easy for you now. Same shit here. Your brain is tricking you. It's not subject, it's just automatic reaction of our brain. See through it, persevere. It'll be hard, starting learning programming is hard, but in the end, you'll do it with fucking excitement and pleasure, I'm telling you. I was absolutely dumb at school, i didn't know what PI is in mathematics, fucking multiplying two digit numbers was my peak achievement. But. I always believed that if I'll decide firmly enough, I can learn anything, because anything can be interesting, extremely interesting, if you put enough focus and effort in it. Five years later, I'm middle Java developer of web applications. I did it, so can you.
